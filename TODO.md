Things i have to do updated to the current state of the app.

✅ Obtain data of moon and calculate against a threshold and a date 
✅ Check if the token as expired an refresh it
❌ Cache the last token refresh. This is so i dont have to use a request everytime i want to check if the token is usable
❌ Use the moon name for the expected arrival time
❌ Connect to a non-relational database and save the data there
❌ Add documentation to every function in the code
